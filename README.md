# Insights Java Client

This repo contains Java code for communicating with Red Hat Insights.

This capability is only available for Red Hat subscribers.

The only authentication flows we support in this release are:

1. mTLS using certs managed by Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM)
2. Bearer token authentication in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

## Building

- Requires Java 11
- The [Spotless Maven Plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven) enforces code formatting conventions and will be run as part of the build.

```
$ mvn clean install
```

To skip the spotless task, run :

	$ mvn clean install -Dskip.spotless=true

Do not raise a PR without having run `spotless:apply` immediately prior.

## License Notes

This project contains some code comprising derivative works based upon open-source code originally released by New Relic.

The original work is also licensed under the Apache 2 License.

## How to test against an ephemeral environment

Here's a command-line guide to uploading some payload:

```
export BASIC_AUTH='the-token'
export HOST='the-host'

curl -F "file=@foo.json.gz;type=application/vnd.redhat.runtimes-java-general.analytics+tgz" \
	-H "Authorization: Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}" \
	"https://${HOST}/api/ingress/v1/upload" -v --insecure
```

Or if you prefer HTTPie:

```
http --verbose --multipart $HOST/api/ingress/v1/upload \
'file@foo.json.gz;type=application/vnd.redhat.runtimes-java-general.analytics+tgz' \
type='application/vnd.redhat.runtimes-java-general.analytics+tgz' \
"Authorization":"Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}"
```

## Environment variables and system properties

The following environment variables are available to be overriden when using `EnvAndSysPropsInsightsConfiguration`.

| Name                                                 | Default value                           | Description                                                          |

JVM system properties are derived from the environment variable names.
For instance `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_KEY_FILE_PATH` becomes `rht.insights.java.key.file.path`.

Note that environment variables take priority over system properties.
