# Insights Java Client

This repo contains Java code for communicating with Red Hat Insights.

This capability is only available for Red Hat subscribers.

The only authentication flows we support in this release are:

1. mTLS using certs managed by Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM)
2. Bearer token authentication in OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

There are four modules within the project:

* agent - A Java agent, supporting Java 8. Implementations need not depend on this
* api - The core API (Java 8). All uses cases will need to depend on this
* jboss-cert-helper - A standalone Go binary that is used to provide access to RHEL certs
* runtime - A Java 11 module that provides an HTTP client and some top-level reports. Most implementations will depend on this.

## Building

- Requires Java 11
- The [Spotless Maven Plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven) enforces code formatting conventions and will be run as part of the build.

```
$ mvn clean install
```

To skip the spotless task, run :

	$ mvn clean install -Dskip.spotless=true

Do not raise a PR without having run `spotless:apply` immediately prior.

## How to test against a token-based (e.g. ephemeral) environment

Here's a command-line guide to uploading some payload:

```
export BASIC_AUTH='the-token'
export HOST='the-host'

curl -F "file=@foo.json.gz;type=application/vnd.redhat.runtimes-java-general.analytics+tgz" \
	-H "Authorization: Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}" \
	"https://${HOST}/api/ingress/v1/upload" -v --insecure
```

Or if you prefer HTTPie:

```
http --verbose --multipart $HOST/api/ingress/v1/upload \
'file@foo.json.gz;type=application/vnd.redhat.runtimes-java-general.analytics+tgz' \
type='application/vnd.redhat.runtimes-java-general.analytics+tgz' \
"Authorization":"Basic ${BASIC_AUTH}"
```

## Environment variables and system properties

For standard, in-process clients, a combination of environment vars & system properties are used to configure the client.
The following environment variables are available to be overriden when using `EnvAndSysPropsInsightsConfiguration`.

| Name                                                 | Default value                           | Description                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_OPT_OUT`                          | `false`                                 | Opt out of Red Hat Insights reporting when `true`                    |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_IDENTIFICATION_NAME`              | N/A, must be defined                    | Identification name for reporting                                    |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_CERT_FILE_PATH`                   | `/etc/pki/consumer/cert.pem`            | Certificate path file                                                |

| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_UPLOAD_BASE_URL`                  | `https://cert.console.stage.redhat.com` | Server endpoint URL                                                  |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_UPLOAD_URI`                       | `/api/ingress/v1/upload`                | Request URI at the server endpoint                                   |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_PROXY_HOST`                       | (empty)                                 | Proxy host, if any                                                   |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_PROXY_PORT`                       | (empty)                                 | Proxy port, if any                                                   |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_CONNECT_PERIOD`                   | 1 day (`P1D`)                           | Connect period, see `java.time.Duration::parse` for the syntax       |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_UPDATE_PERIOD`                    | 5 minutes (`PT5M`)                      | Update period, see `java.time.Duration::parse` for the syntax        |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_HTTP_CLIENT_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY`  | 2000 (milliseconds as `long`)           | HTTP client exponential backoff: initial retry delay in milliseconds |
| `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_HTTP_CLIENT_RETRY_BACKOFF_FACTOR` | 2 (`long`)                              | HTTP client exponential backoff: factor                              |

JVM system properties are derived from the environment variable names.
For instance `RHT_INSIGHTS_JAVA_KEY_FILE_PATH` becomes `rht.insights.java.key.file.path`.

Note that environment variables take priority over system properties.

## Java agent args string

When using the agent in the startup configuration, the usual agent args string technique is used.
That is, the path to the agent jar is followed by an `=` and then the rest of the argument is passed as a single string to the agent.

In our case, the args are passed as key-value pairs, separated by `;`. For example:

```
-javaagent:runtimes-java-agent-1.0.0.jar=name=my_app;token=amXXXXYYYYZZZZj
```

Note that the use of `;` means that on Unix, means that the javaagent argument will typically need to be quoted.

The available key-value pairs are:

| Name         | Default value                           | Description                                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `optOut`     | `false`                                 | Opt out of Red Hat Insights reporting when `true`  |
| `name`       | N/A, must be defined                    | Identification name for reporting                  |
| `cert`       | `/etc/pki/consumer/cert.pem`            | Certificate path file                              |
| `key`        | `/etc/pki/consumer/key.pem`             | Certificate key file                               |
| `token`      | (empty)                                 | Authentication token for token-based auth, if used |
| `base_url`   | `https://cert.console.stage.redhat.com` | Server endpoint URL                                |
| `uri`        | `/api/ingress/v1/upload`                | Request URI at the server endpoint                 |
| `proxy`      | (empty)                                 | Proxy host, if any                                 |
| `proxy_port` | (empty)                                 | Proxy port, if any                                 |
